# JavaScript CRUD Application (React-Style Logic)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Although React is not used, the application is designed by following **React-style concepts** such as **state management, immutability, conditional rendering, and re-rendering UI on state change**.

This project is ideal for **beginners**, **internship submissions**, and **React JS developers** who want to understand core CRUD logic before moving to React.
